# Image-Classification-and-Object-Detection
This repository highlights some of my work in the domain of credit scoring algorithms using Image Classification and Object Detection. Additionally I have also provided a pdf document so as to enable users to run the notebook on their system. Another word file is added to keep track of my progress and challeges faced during modeling process.
I have scrapped dataset from internet. Altough you can train it on ur own dataset. The structure of input dataset is of the form folder: class1, class2,.. , classn. Split is taken care of within the model.
